Menelaus takes this opportunity to \"outbid\" Jason for the priesthood, resulting in Antiochus IV confirming Menelaus as the High Priest.",

      ", April 16\u2014A solar eclipse occurs over the Ionian Sea. This may have marked the return of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, to his kingdom after the Trojan War. He discovers a number of suitors competing to marry his wife Penelope, whom they believe to be a widow, in order to succeed him on the throne. He organizes their slaying and re-establishes himself on the throne. The date is surmised from a passage in Homer's Odyssey, which reads, \"The Sun has been obliterated from the sky, and an unlucky darkness invades the world.\" This happens in the context of a new moon, a necessary precondition for a full solar eclipse, and at noon, the computed time of the solar eclipse of April 16,. In 2008, to investigate, Dr Marcelo O. Magnasco, an astronomer at Rockefeller University, and Constantino Baikouzis, of the Observatorio Astr\u00f3nomico de La Plata in Argentina, looked for more clues. Within the text, they interpreted three definitive astronomical events: there was a new moon on the day of the slaughter (as required for a solar eclipse); Venus was visible and high in the sky six days before; and the constellations Pleiades and Bo\u00f6tes were both visible at sunset 29 days before. Since these events recur at different intervals, this particular sequence only occurs once in 2000 years. The researchers found only one occurrence of this sequence between and, the 135-year spread around the putative date for the fall of Troy. It happened to coincide with the eclipse of April 16,.",
