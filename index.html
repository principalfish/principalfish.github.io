				<p>
					I'm Phil. Born in Nottingham in 1988 I grew up in the North East of England,
					going to high school in Morpeth.
					I attended Durham University and studied Maths from 2006 to 2009.
					After graduating I spent 6 years playing poker for a living.
					During that time I lived in London and travelled around the world to play.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have always loved maps and followed politics closely so decided to combine
					the two and make a set of <a href="/electionmaps/">interactive UK Election Maps</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time I enjoy hillwalking, amateur astronomy and playing Hearthstone.
				</p>

				<h5>Note Sep 29th 2018</h5>
				<p>
					In September 2017 I started woring as a software developer and due to that and various other things this site has been neglected.
					I will not have time to do anything for the US mid terms this year.

				</p>

				<p>
					However, I will (hopefully) be moving house before the end of the year and after that I should be able to find more time to start updating / expanding the site.
