## Where we are
Issue 0002 "Import 2018–2026 US House and Senate results from NYT data" is building (GitHub #79). Pieces 1–5 and 7 are committed and pushed.
State checks: `git -C <build worktree> rev-parse --short HEAD` = `f90f26d3` on branch `import-2026-us-midterm-results`, clean tree, pushed (`git status -sb` shows no "ahead"); `python3 ~/.claude/lib/planner.py meta 0002` shows state building.
If anything differs, stop and tell the user.

Owned by the planner chat `planner: import-2026-us-midterm-results` (main checkout). Draft PR #80 (`gh pr view 80 --json state,isDraft`).

Builder `builder: import-2026-us-midterm-results` started 2026-11-07 (session `local_33a550dd-f3e8-4148-865d-3673210013ae`; `list_sessions` with `linked: true`). Open for Phil: merge order with 0001 — conflicts already exist (see plan.md Notes, overlap check); suggested: merge master in after #74 lands, before piece 8.

Piece 6 committed `bfe5dc77`. Merge order: merge master in after #74 lands, before piece 11 and the final review, then re-run the jsdom harness on both pages.

Pending: piece 8 built, uncommitted, in `.claude/worktrees/great-nightingale-9085bc` (`git -C <that> status --short`), waiting on Phil's review. Open for Phil: (1) mid-count ± in the totals table (leave / label provisional / credit leaders; builder recommends leave); (3) whether piece 9's brief should decide how a predict baseline treats uncalled seats (builder suggests adding it). The hatch look needs a real-browser check once 2026 data is exported (piece 11).

Next step: checkpoint 8 (in progress). See `plan.md`.

## Don't
- Run imports, migrations or exports against the live DB without Phil's explicit go-ahead at the time.
- Try to get past the NYT HTML captcha; use only the static CDN JSON.
