## Where we are
Issue 0002 "Import 2018–2026 US House and Senate results from NYT data" is building (GitHub #79). Pieces 1–5 and 7 are committed and pushed.
State checks: `git -C <build worktree> rev-parse --short HEAD` = `f90f26d3` on branch `import-2026-us-midterm-results`, clean tree, pushed (`git status -sb` shows no "ahead"); `python3 ~/.claude/lib/planner.py meta 0002` shows state building.
If anything differs, stop and tell the user.

Owned by the planner chat `planner: import-2026-us-midterm-results` (main checkout). Draft PR #80 (`gh pr view 80 --json state,isDraft`).

Builder `builder: import-2026-us-midterm-results` started 2026-11-07 (session `local_33a550dd-f3e8-4148-865d-3673210013ae`; `list_sessions` with `linked: true`). Open for Phil: merge order with 0001 — conflicts already exist (see plan.md Notes, overlap check); suggested: merge master in after #74 lands, before piece 8.

Pending: piece 6 (House maps 24/25) is built, uncommitted, in worktree `.claude/worktrees/great-nightingale-9085bc` (`git -C <that> status --short`), waiting on Phil's review. Open: confirm the source deviation (Census TIGER2026 cd120 files for all nine redrawn states instead of per-state enacted-plan downloads; plan.md Notes, piece 6). On approval, relay it quoted to the builder to commit and push, then tick #80's checklist.

Next step after that: checkpoint 8. See `plan.md`.

## Don't
- Run imports, migrations or exports against the live DB without Phil's explicit go-ahead at the time.
- Try to get past the NYT HTML captcha; use only the static CDN JSON.
